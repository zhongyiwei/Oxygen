                <p>Goal Setting motivates a person to reach their specific goals by defining it clearly and achieving it as “our values create within us a desire to behave in a way that is consistent with our goals”</p>

                <p><strong><u>For Students:</u></strong></p>
                <p>Goals which measure academic success might include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>an increase in grade point average</li>
                    <li>improvement in note taking effectiveness</li>

                <p>We found that specific, difficult goals consistently led to higher performance than urging people to do their best. The effect sizes in meta-analyses ranged from .42 to .80 (Locke & Latham, 1990). In short, when people are asked to do their best, they do not do so. This is because do-your-best goals have no external referent and thus are defined idiosyncratically. This allows for a wide range of acceptable performance levels, which is not the case when a goal level is specified. Goal specificity in itself does not necessarily lead to high performance because specific goals vary in difficulty. However, insofar as performance is fully controllable, goal specificity does reduce variation in performance by reducing the ambiguity about what is to be attained (Locke, Chah, Harrison, & Lustgarten, 1989)</p>
                <p>That said, when people are confronted with a task that is complex for them, encouragement (e.g., urging to do their best) sometimes leads to better solving strategies than setting a specific difficult performance goal.</p>

                <h2>The Coat of Arms: </h2>
                <p>A coat of arms is a distinctive heraldic design on a tunic used to cover and protect armor, but the term is more broadly applied to mean a full heraldic achievement which consists of a shield and certain accessories. In either sense, the design is a symbol unique to a person, family, corporation, or state. Such displays are also commonly called armorial bearings, armorial devices, heraldic devices, or arms.</p>
